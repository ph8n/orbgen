# [Orbgen] - A High-Performance N-Body Gravity Simulation Engine

## Project Overview

This project is an ambitious endeavor to create a performant and complex N-body gravity simulation engine using the C programming language. The goal is to dynamically simulate the gravitational interactions of multiple celestial bodies (planets, stars, etc.) and visualize their movements with a high degree of graphical detail and performance.

## Goals

* **Accurate N-Body Simulation:** Implement accurate numerical integration methods (e.g., Leapfrog, Runge-Kutta) to simulate the gravitational forces and resulting movements of multiple bodies based on Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation.
* **Support for a Large Number of Bodies:** Design the simulation and rendering pipeline to handle a significant number of celestial bodies without significant performance degradation.
* **Dynamic Interactions:** Accurately simulate the complex gravitational interactions between all simulated bodies.
* **Visualization:** Create a compelling visual representation of the simulation, potentially including:
  * Rendering of planets, stars, and other celestial objects.
  * Drawing orbital trails.
  * Basic ambient lighting or shading.
  * Camera controls (zoom, pan, orbit).
* **Modularity and Extensibility:** Structure the code in a modular way to allow for future expansion, such as adding different celestial body types, physical effects, or visualization features.
